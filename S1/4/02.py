# When gasoline is $100 per barrel, then the consumers price at the pump is between $3.50
# and $4.00 per gallon. Create a class named GasPrices. Its main() method holds an integer
# variable named pricePerBarrel to which you will assign a value entered by a user at the
# keyboard. Create a method to which you pass pricePerBarrel. The method displays the
# range of possible prices per gallon. For example, if gas is $120 per barrel, then the price at
# the pump should be between $4.20 and $4.80. Save the application as GasPrices.java.

# Assume that a gallon of paint covers about 350 square feet of wall space. Create an
# application with a main() method that prompts the user for the length, width, and
# height of a rectangular room. Pass these three values to a method that does the
# following:
# l Calculates the wall area for a room
# l Passes the calculated wall area to another method that calculates and returns the
# number of gallons of paint needed
# l Displays the number of gallons needed
# l Computes the price based on a paint price of $32 per gallon, assuming that
# the painter can buy any fraction of a gallon of paint at the same price as a
# whole gallon
# l Returns the price to the main() method
# The main() method displays the final price. For example, the cost to paint a
# 15- by-20-foot room with 10-foot ceilings is $64. Save the application as
# PaintCalculator.java.

# Create a class named Student. A Student has fields for an ID number, number of
# credit hours earned, and number of points earned. (For example, many schools
# compute grade point averages based on a scale of 4, so a three-credit-hour class in
# which a student earns an A is worth 12 points.) Include methods to assign values
# to all fields. A Student also has a field for grade point average. Include a method
# to compute the grade point average field by dividing points by credit hours
# earned. Write methods to display the values in each Student field. Save this class
# as Student.java.
# b. Write a class named ShowStudent that instantiates a Student object from the
# class you created and assign values to its fields. Compute the Student grade point
# average, and then display all the values associated with the Student. Save the
# application as ShowStudent.java.
# c. Create a constructor for the Student class you created. The constructor should
# initialize each Students ID number to 9999, his or her points earned to 12, and
# credit hours to 3 (resulting in a grade point average of 4.0). Write a program that
# demonstrates that the constructor works by instantiating an object and displaying
# the initial values. Save the application as ShowStudent2.java.

# Create a class named Painting that contains fields for a paintingâ€™s title, artist,
# medium (such as water color), price, and gallery commission. Create a
# constructor that initializes each field to an appropriate default value, and
# create instance methods that get and set the fields for title, artist, medium, and
# price. The gallery commission field cannot be set from outside the class; it is
# computed as 20 percent of the price each time the price is set. Save the class as
# Painting.java.
# b. Create a class named TestPainting whose main() method declares three
# Painting items. Create a method that prompts the user for and accepts values
# for two of the Painting objects, and leave the third with the default values
# supplied by the constructor. Then display each completed object. Finally, display
# a message that explains the gallery commission rate. Save the application as
